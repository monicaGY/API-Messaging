# API - Messaging
This **RESTful API**, developed with **Laravel**, follows the **Hexagonal Architecture**, which allows a clear separation between business logic and external layers such as controllers, persistence, or external services. This design promotes a **decoupled, domain-driven** and highly testable architecture.

The project consistently applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles along with the **SOLID principles**, ensuring **clean, maintainable, and scalable** code.

### Key Features

- üîê **Token-based authentication** using Laravel Sanctum to securely protect endpoints.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Custom and authentication middlewares** that control access, such as verifying if a user belongs to a conversation before allowing message actions.
- ‚úÖ **Custom request validators** to ensure incoming JSON payloads have the correct structure and valid data before processing.
- üå± **Database seeders** to populate the database with initial data, useful for development and testing environments.
- üß™ **Automated testing with Mockery**, enabling effective unit testing through dependency mocking.
- üìö **API documentation via Swagger (OpenAPI)**, allowing easy exploration and interaction with the available endpoints.
- üê≥ **Docker support**, making it simple to deploy and run the API in reproducible environments suitable for development, staging, or production.
